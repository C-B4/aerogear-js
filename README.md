aerogear-js
===========

JavaScript client library implementation for AeroGear. Eventually, this will include API's for persistence, security, data synchronization and more.

Pipeline
--------

Pipeline is a JavaScript library that provides a persistence API that is protocol agnostic and does not depend on any certain data model. Through the use of adapters, both provided and custom, user supplied, this library provides common methods like read, save and delete that will just work.

See the [API docs](http://aerogear.github.com/aerogear-js/pipeline) for more info.
